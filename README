This project is a set of web development files I've created(html, css, PHP,
JavaScript, or whatever else I decide to learn) while on my journey to web
development ninja-hood. These files will contain the basic functionality of
the parts that make up each file. They will be mostly for reference for me
while developing when I need to know how to do a particular task. Feel free
to use and modify them as you wish but I give no guarantee that they will 
even work so use at your own risk.

I will also be using this project to learn to use git so some of the 
comments may reflect that as well.
